NAME
    Image::LibExif - Read EXIF. Efficiently

SYNOPSIS
        use Image::LibExif;
    
        my $exif = image_exif("source.jpg");
        if (defined $exif) {
            print Dumper $exif;
        } else {
            print "Exif not found\n";
        }

DESCRIPTION
    Very simple and very fast (about 30 times faster than Image::ExifTool)
    EXIF extractor, based on libexif.

  EXPORT
    image_exif

SEE ALSO
    *   Image::ExifTool - Very powerful EXIF manipulation module, but a bit
        slow

    *   Image::EXIF - Another EXIF reader, that is an implementation of
        exiftags in XS. I've encounter a lot segfaults there.

    *   Image::JpegTran - Lossless JPEG transformation utility. XS wrap of
        jpegtran from libjpeg
